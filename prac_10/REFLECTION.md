# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?
About 80%.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
My estimate changes on the code format that we have to follow throughout the course of the subject.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?
To make sure the code is as readable as much as I can, in order to benefit other programmers.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
In order to apply good practices when writing code such as meaningful variable names, etc.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
In order to help other people from improving their coding ability.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Practical 6 Review](https://github.com/litiansu0/cp1404practicals/pull/2)

### Explanation
Instead of mentioning what went wrong on the code, I tried to provide suggestion on how it would improve the code.

### Good Code Review 2
[Practical 8 Review](https://github.com/mayur-ramesh/cp1404practicals/pull/4#pullrequestreview-2745190093)

### Explanation
As much as people underestimate variable names, it should be meaningful as people can read what the variable actually represents.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
I would extend the practical due date by a week, due to one of the practical's date where students need to ask questions are close to the due date.
I also want to actively engage with all of the students as much as I can.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
I would say getting the code to work is my specialty, since it is the main thing that programmers have to master.
