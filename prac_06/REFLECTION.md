# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have reevaluated myself on making use of variables more and using meaningful names for them.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to do all my practical as soon after I attend the workshop for any clarification, I also need to pay attention
to any key information that lecturer presents so that I can ace the exam.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

So far, I am doing pretty well, still a bit of minor errors in coding such as less commenting on the code and bad variable
names

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Getting to know the most commonly used traits in programming, such as using all caps for constant, plural forms for list,
and make use of functions to simplify coding.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

The unit has demonstrated a great explanation for the students, considering most possibilities of every python function
to encourage student to do trial-and-error by themselves, one request I do have is that the lecturer could think of a fun
activity to keep students engaged in class and participate in short answer questions asked by the lecturer.
