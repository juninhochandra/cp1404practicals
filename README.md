# CP1404 Practicals
## Hello, my name is Juninho, I am currently doing my bachelor degree on JCU, this repository is about my practical submissions on one of the programming unit I am currently enrolled. 
- I learned that I need to make reasonable name for variables.
- I learned that I need to refactor code regularly to avoid putting everything in the main function.
- I learned that I need to do optimization while keeping the readability of my code
