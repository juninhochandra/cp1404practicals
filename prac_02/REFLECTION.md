# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I watched all the full lectures 1-2 days before the practical week at my home, either in the morning or night.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I would say applying logic and recognizing syntax errors is my specialty. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I will make changes to match with the overall lectures' condition on designing my code.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Doing the design based on the expectation of the lecturer is the hardest part, it's complicated to guess which one they considered as a constant, meaningful comments, etc.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Definitely getting the problem done, excluding the readability.
